# Chapter 11: Data Analysis & Business Intelligence

Data analysts and business intelligence professionals transform raw data into actionable insights that drive decision-making. AI prompting can enhance these functions by structuring analysis approaches, creating visualization frameworks, identifying patterns in data, and communicating findings effectively to various stakeholders. The prompts in this chapter help data teams extract meaningful insights and present them in compelling, action-oriented formats.

Effective data analysis prompting requires clear analytical frameworks, best practices for visualization, and storytelling techniques that connect data points to business implications. These specialized prompt frameworks support the entire analytics process—from question formulation and data exploration through analysis, visualization, and insight communication—while adapting to various analytical contexts, from exploratory analysis to regular reporting and predictive modeling.
