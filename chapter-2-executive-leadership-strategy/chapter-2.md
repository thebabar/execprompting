# Chapter 2: Executive Leadership & Strategy

For executive leaders, AI prompting offers unprecedented efficiency in strategic analysis, decision-making, and communication. This chapter focuses on prompting techniques specifically designed for leadership contexts, ranging from board-level communications to crisis management and emergency response. The right prompt structures can transform how executives process information, evaluate options, and articulate vision, enabling faster and more comprehensive strategic thinking.

**Strategic Assessment**

Quick-Look Definition: Creating a comprehensive approach to evaluate strategic opportunities, threats, and organizational capabilities to guide strategic decision-making.

Starter Prompt:

As a strategic advisor, evaluate this market opportunity: [DESCRIBE OPPORTUNITY]. What are the key advantages and risks?  

Why It Works:

- Role specificity activates industry-relevant knowledge
- The structured analysis format ensures comprehensive coverage
- Explicit sections force prioritization of the most important factors
- KPI requirement ensures measurable success definition
- The board-ready format focuses on decision-relevant information

**Decision Frameworks**

Quick-Look Definition: Creating a structured methodology for evaluating complex strategic decisions with multiple variables, stakeholders, and potential outcomes.

Starter Prompt:

How should I decide whether to [STRATEGIC OPTION]? What factors should I consider?

Executive Prompt:

As a decision science specialist with C-suite advisory experience, create a decision framework for evaluating whether to [STRATEGIC OPTION].

First, identify the five most critical decision criteria, with a rationale for each.

Then, develop a weighted scoring matrix for evaluating alternatives against these criteria.

Next, outline the three most viable options (including the status quo) and assess each against your framework.

Finally, recommend a structured process for making this decision, including:

- key stakeholders to involve,
- critical data to gather,
- potential cognitive biases to mitigate, and
- implementation considerations.

Why It Works:

- Decision science specialist role brings sophisticated decision-making methodology
- Weighted criteria establish clear prioritization of factors
- Status quo inclusion forces explicit comparison to the current state
- The bias mitigation component improves decision quality

**Bonus Prompt: Leadership Team Alignment**

As an organizational alignment consultant, I design a structured approach to build consensus among my leadership team on our [STRATEGIC INITIATIVE].

Our team comprises seven executives with diverse functional backgrounds and priorities. Several have expressed competing perspectives on implementation approach and resource allocation.

Create a framework that includes:

- Pre-work materials to establish shared understanding
- A half-day workshop design with specific exercises
- Decision-making methods for resolving key points of disagreement
- Post-meeting accountability mechanisms
- Success metrics for both the alignment process and implementation outcomes

Optimize for both efficiency and psychological safety while making informed decisions.

**Bonus Prompt: Strategic Communication Planning**

As a strategic communication advisor, create a comprehensive 90-day messaging plan for our upcoming [INITIATIVE/CHANGE].

This plan will affect multiple stakeholders, including [LIST KEY STAKEHOLDERS].

Develop a communication strategy that includes:

- Core narrative and key messages tailored to each stakeholder group
- Sequencing and timing recommendations (what to communicate when)
- Format and channel recommendations for different message components
- 
- Potential resistance points and preemptive messaging approaches
- Feedback mechanisms to gauge message effectiveness

Format this as a strategic communication playbook that our leadership team can implement consistently.

**Bonus Prompt: Change Management Strategy**

As a change management expert, design a structured approach for implementing [ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE] while minimizing disruption and resistance.

Current context:

- [DESCRIBE CURRENT SITUATION]
- [DESCRIBE URGENCY DRIVERS]
- [DESCRIBE STAKEHOLDER LANDSCAPE]


Create a comprehensive change strategy including:

- Stakeholder analysis with influence/impact mapping
- Resistance assessment and mitigation approaches
- Communication strategy across key phases (awareness, understanding, buy-in, action)
- Leadership role definition and required behaviors
- Success metrics to track adoption and effectiveness
- Timeline with key milestones and critical path activities
