# Chapter 19: Strategic & Decision-Making Tasks

Strategic thinking involves defining direction, allocating resources, and making high-impact decisions across all organizational functions. This chapter focuses on prompt strategies that enhance strategic processes regardless of specific role, helping users evaluate opportunities, develop long-term plans, make complex decisions, and align organizational capabilities with market needs.

Effective strategic prompting requires understanding how to frame complex questions, evaluate multiple dimensions, consider long-term implications, and strike a balance between competing priorities. These prompts are effective across disciplines, clarifying vision, analyzing environments, assessing options, and developing executable strategies. By applying these techniques, professionals in any field can enhance their strategic thinking and decision-making capabilities.

**Sample Prompt:**

Scenario Planning

Quick-Look Definition: Developing structured approaches to anticipate and prepare for alternative future states.

Starter Prompt:

How might our industry evolve over the next five years?

Executive Prompt:

As a strategic foresight specialist, develop a comprehensive scenario planning framework for [ORGANIZATION/INDUSTRY] over the next [TIMEFRAME].

Create a structured approach including:
1) 5-7 critical uncertainties that could significantly impact future outcomes
2) 2x2 scenario matrix based on the two most essential uncertainties
3) Detailed narrative for each quadrant describing the business environment, customer behavior, competitive landscape, and technology evolution
4) Opportunity and threat assessment for each scenario
5) Early indicators that would signal movement toward each scenario
6) Strategic response options that would position us well across multiple scenarios
7) "No-regrets" moves that make sense regardless of which scenario unfolds

Format as a strategic foresight framework that prepares the organization for multiple futures rather than predicting a single outcome.

Why It Works:
- Multiple uncertainties create more nuanced future possibilities.
- Detailed narratives make abstract futures tangible for planning.
- Early indicators create an ongoing monitoring system.

Optional Add-On: "Include a portfolio approach to strategic initiatives that balance 'core,' 'adjacent,' and 'transformational' opportunities across scenarios."
