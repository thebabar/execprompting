# Three Ways of Interacting with AI

There are three main ways of interacting with AI. 

Train | Prompt | Configure output parameters

There are finer-grained controls as well (e.g. RAG) but let's start with the key controls or levers.

3️⃣ Training (including fine-tuning) takes the most work and effort ($$$).
2️⃣ Prompting (use text instructions to guide the model’s behavior at runtime) is the most common and flexible way, excellent ROI!
1️⃣ Configuring output parameters (aka Sampling) is the least know and a real competitive advantage. By adjusting runtime configuration options you can guide how the model generates text. 

Prompting is the most common and most impactful of them all.
