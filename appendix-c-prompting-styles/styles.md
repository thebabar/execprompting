# Appendix C: Prompting Use Styles

Different prompting approaches can be more effective for various types of tasks and objectives. This appendix outlines major prompting styles and when to use each.

**Directive Style**

Best for: Specific, well-defined outputs where you know exactly what you want. Characteristics: Clear instructions, specific parameters, explicit format requirements. 

Example:
Create a 5-day social media content calendar for a fitness brand launching a new protein powder. Include one post per day with the following for each: platform (alternate between Instagram and Facebook), post copy (maximum 100 words), hashtag suggestions (3-5), and optimal posting time. Each post should highlight a different benefit of the product.

**Collaborative Style**

Best for Complex problems where you want to leverage the AI's reasoning capabilities alongside your expertise. Characteristics: Staged approach, feedback loops, building on previous outputs 

Example:
I need to develop a customer retention strategy for our SaaS business. Let's approach this step-by-step.
First, help me identify the typical reasons customers might churn from a SaaS platform like ours. After we discuss those, we'll move on to potential retention tactics.

**Exploratory Style**

Best for: Ideation, brainstorming, and examining multiple possibilities. Characteristics: Open-ended, seeks diverse options, encourages varied approaches. Example:

Example: I'm considering different approaches for our team's quarterly planning process. Generate five distinctly different methods we could use, ranging from traditional to innovative. For each, explain the basic approach, key benefits, potential drawbacks, and one company that has successfully utilized this method.

**Socratic Style**

Best for: Learning, developing understanding, examining assumptions Characteristics: Question-based, probing, builds understanding through inquiry Example:

Example: I'm trying to understand market segmentation strategies better. Instead of just explaining them to me, please use a Socratic approach where you ask me guiding questions that help me think through the key considerations, standard techniques, and evaluation methods. After each of my responses, provide brief feedback and then a new question to deepen my understanding.

**Technical Style**

Best for: Scientific, technical, or specialized domain tasks requiring precision Characteristics: Domain-specific terminology, structured frameworks, methodological approach Example:

Example: As a statistical analyst, evaluate the following experimental design for measuring the effect of price changes on purchase behavior. Identify potential confounding variables, suggest controls to implement, and recommend appropriate statistical tests for analyzing the results. Present your analysis in technical language suitable for a research team with advanced statistical knowledge.

**Narrative Style**

Best for: Creating engaging content, scenarios, or explanations that tell a story. Characteristics: Story structure, character/scenario development, emotional engagement 

Example:
Develop a customer journey narrative that illustrates the experience of a first-time user of our home meal kit delivery service. Create a specific persona and walk through their experience from discovery to first order to fourth month of usage, highlighting key touchpoints, emotional responses, and decision factors at each stage. The narrative should feel authentic and highlight both positive aspects and potential friction points.
