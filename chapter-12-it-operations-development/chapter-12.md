# Chapter 12: IT Operations & Development

IT operations and development professionals design, build, and maintain the technological infrastructure and applications that power modern organizations. AI prompting can enhance these functions by debugging code, documenting systems, troubleshooting issues, and creating development specifications. The prompts in this chapter help IT teams work more efficiently while maintaining system reliability and code quality.

Effective IT and development prompting requires technical precision, methodological frameworks, and clear documentation practices that transform complex technical concepts into actionable guidance. These specialized prompt frameworks support the full technology lifecycle—from requirements gathering and development through deployment, monitoring, and incident response—while adapting to various technical contexts, from infrastructure management to application development.

**Sample Prompt:**

Bug Detection & Fixing


Quick-Look Definition: Using AI to identify errors or bugs in code and suggest fixes by analyzing error messages and code snippets, providing step-by-step solutions for debugging.

Starter Prompt:

I'm getting a NullPointerException in my Java program. How can I fix it?

Executive Prompt:

You are a senior software engineer. First, explain in simple terms the likely cause of a given error. Next, suggest a specific solution to resolve the issue. Finally, provide the corrected code snippet along with comments that explain the changes.

Why It Works:

Breaks the task into explanation, solution, and code steps, allowing the AI to follow a logical process instead of jumping straight to a fix.
Requests commented code as output, ensuring the fix is provided with explanations to add clarity and educate the user.
Optional Add-On: Append "Also suggest how to prevent this type of bug in the future." for proactive best practices.
