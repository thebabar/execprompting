# Chapter 16: Analytical & Logical Thinking

Analytical thinking involves breaking down complex problems, evaluating evidence, identifying patterns, and drawing logical conclusions. This chapter focuses on prompt strategies that enhance analytical processes across any professional role, helping users structure their thinking, develop frameworks, analyze options, and make data-driven decisions.

Regardless of domain expertise, strong analytical prompting enables more structured problem-solving, more explicit reasoning, and more rigorous decision processes. These prompts work across disciplines to create logical frameworks, uncover hidden assumptions, identify causal relationships, and ensure that conclusions follow logically from premises. By applying these techniques, professionals in any field can enhance the quality of their analysis and reasoning.

**Sample Prompt:**

Decision Analysis Framework

Quick-Look Definition: Creating structured approaches to evaluate options and make choices based on clear criteria.

Starter Prompt:
Help me decide between these three options.

Executive Prompt:
As a decision analyst, create a comprehensive evaluation framework for choosing between [OPTIONS] for [PURPOSE]. 

First, establish 5-7 critical decision criteria with clear definitions and relative importance weights. 

Then, develop a scoring system and apply it to each option, showing calculations. 

Next, perform a sensitivity analysis on key assumptions to test the robustness of the recommendation. 

Finally, present your recommendation with clear rationale and implementation considerations.

Why It Works:
- Criteria weighting forces explicit prioritization of factors.
- Sensitivity analysis determines the stability of the conclusion under various assumptions.
- Implementation considerations bridge from decision to action.
- Optional Add-On: "Include decision tree analysis for any sequential or conditional elements of the decision."
