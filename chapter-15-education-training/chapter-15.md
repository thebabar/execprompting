# Chapter 15: Education & Training

Education and training professionals design learning experiences that efficiently and effectively build knowledge and skills. AI prompting can enhance these functions by creating instructional materials, developing assessments, personalizing learning paths, and organizing curriculum content. The prompts in this chapter help educators and trainers design more engaging and compelling learning experiences.

Effective education prompting requires learning science principles, audience-appropriate communication, and structured instructional design that promotes knowledge retention and application. These specialized prompt frameworks support various educational workflows—from lesson planning and content creation to assessment development and learning analysis—while adapting to diverse educational contexts, including K-12 and higher education, as well as corporate training and professional development.
