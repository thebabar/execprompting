**SHADOW AI & UNAUTHORIZED TOOL**
Let's begin with a growing challenge many organizations face: shadow AI.
Shadow AI refers to the use of unauthorized AI tools by employees without proper security vetting or organizational approval. It's similar to "shadow IT"—when employees use personal cloud storage or unapproved apps for work purposes—but with additional risks specific to AI.
This typically happens when employees discover convenient AI tools that solve immediate problems. Perhaps your company's approved AI tool is slow or struggles with specific tasks. Possibly, your organization hasn't yet provided an official AI solution. In these situations, employees often turn to public, consumer-grade AI tools, such as free chatbots or image generators, to get their work done.
While this may seem harmless, consider the following real-world example: In 2023, several major companies, including Samsung and Apple, discovered that employees had inadvertently leaked confidential code when using public AI chatbots. The employees needed help debugging code and didn't realize that everything they shared was potentially being stored and used to further train the AI system. This not only exposed proprietary information but also created potential legal vulnerabilities around intellectual property.

Shadow AI becomes particularly risky because many employees don't realize that information shared with these systems may be:
- Stored indefinitely
- Used to train the AI further
- Potentially accessible to the vendor's employees
- Not covered by your organization's data protection agreements
- Rather than simply circumventing official channels, employees should document capabilities they need but don't currently have access to. This helps organizational leaders understand gaps in their AI strategy and address legitimate business needs through properly vetted tools.
